        <p>
          William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[a] was an
          English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the
          greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest
          dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's national poet and the
          "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").[5][b] His extant works,
          including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets,
          three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
          authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living
          language and are performed more often than those of any other
          playwright.[7] His works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.
          Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.
          At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three
          children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585
          and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer,
          and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men,
          later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to
          have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few
          records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated
          considerable speculation about such matters as his physical
          appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works
          attributed to him were written by others.[8][9][10] Shakespeare
          produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[11][12][d] His
          early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as
          some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly
          tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello,
          King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in
          the English language.[2][3][4] In the last phase of his life, he wrote
          tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other
          playwrights. Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of
          varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two
          fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry
          Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a
          posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
          included all but two of his plays.[13] Its Preface was a prescient
          poem by Ben Jonson that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous
          epithet: "not of an age, but for all time".[13]

        <h2>life</h2>
        <p>
          Early life Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman
          and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from Snitterfield in
          Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning
          family.[14] He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised
          on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally
          observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[15] This date, which can be
          traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to
          biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[16][17]
          He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[18]
          John Shakespeare's house, believed to be Shakespeare's birthplace, in
          Stratford-upon-Avon Although no attendance records for the period
          survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated
          at the King's New School in Stratford,[19][20][21] a free school
          chartered in 1553,[22] about a quarter-mile (400 m) from his home.
          Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but
          grammar school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text
          was standardised by royal decree,[23][24] and the school would have
          provided an intensive education in grammar based upon Latin classical
          authors.[25] At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne
          Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a
          marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's
          neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the
          marriage.[26] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since
          the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once
          instead of the usual three times,[27][28] and six months after the
          marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May
          1583.[29] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two
          years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[30] Hamnet died of
          unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[31]
          Shakespeare's coat of arms, as it appears on the rough draft of the
          application to grant a coat-of-arms to John Shakespeare. It features a
          spear as a pun on the family name.[e] After the birth of the twins,
          Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part
          of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance
          of his name in the "complaints bill" of a law case before the Queen's
          Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October
          1589.[32] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as
          Shakespeare's "lost years".[33] Biographers attempting to account for
          this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe,
          Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that
          Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer
          poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is
          also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a
          scurrilous ballad about him.[34][35] Another 18th-century story has
          Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of
          theatre patrons in London.[36] John Aubrey reported that Shakespeare
          had been a country schoolmaster.[37] Some 20th-century scholars
          suggested that Shakespeare may have been employed as a schoolmaster by
          Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a
          certain "William Shakeshafte" in his will.[38][39] Little evidence
          substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after his
          death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire
          area.[40][41]
